## Introduction  
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. This repository showcases practical implementations of various **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral** patterns, aiming to serve as a study guide and reference for developers.

---

## Design Patterns Implemented  
### 1. Creational Patterns  
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.  
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.  
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.  
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects.  

### 2. Structural Patterns  
- **Adapter**: Converts an interface into another interface expected by the client.  
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionality dynamically to objects.  
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures.  
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate for another object.  
- **Bridge**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation.  

### 3. Behavioral Patterns  
- **Observer**: Allows objects to notify others about changes.  
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms and makes them interchangeable.  
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
